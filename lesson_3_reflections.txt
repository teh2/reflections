I wonder what the first reflection for lesson 3 is going to be?

  No idea, but I bet it'll be interesting.

So, here it is:

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I would choose to use a remote repository in at least two situations. First, when I'm working with other developers - that way, we can all see the code. And we can work together. Second, I'd use a remote repository when it's likely that I'll be making updates from multiple computers. This would give me the ability to update the code from anywhere, on any device.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If you are in the middle of a major feature addition, you would be better off working from a stable code base. If your collaborator starts pushing a major change, and gets distracted in the middle, you might get only part of the change and your local copy might not work very well.
