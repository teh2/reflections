I wonder what the first reflection for lesson 3 is going to be?

  No idea, but I bet it'll be interesting.

So, here it is:

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I would choose to use a remote repository in at least two situations. First, when I'm working with other developers - that way, we can all see the code. And we can work together. Second, I'd use a remote repository when it's likely that I'll be making updates from multiple computers. This would give me the ability to update the code from anywhere, on any device.
