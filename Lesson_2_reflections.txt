What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creats the .git folder, which holds the initial metadata for the repository. I assume that it will eventually hold all of the commit information as well...

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is not a "real" directory. It just exists as meta data (down inside of .git). But it allows you to collect up the pieces of your project in preparation for the commit. I would think that some times, it would be difficult to pull together all of the items for a commit in one enormous command line. And, what if you changed your mind? There must be a way to remove something from the "staging area". Right?
